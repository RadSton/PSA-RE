# TODO: Better front end

Well its not the best but for this help is needed; my main focus is functionallity and no bleeding eyes with my minimal css skills

# Maybe move search from server to client 

I dont remeber why I did it this way but it makes more sense and hosting resources (currenlty less than toaster) go down 

# Properly rethink how the UI should work

I tried to make it easy / understandable and I really couldnt think of anything better / easier to implement

# SPA (already fixed)

At first I went with a SPA design but it turned out to be a suffering afterwards so I decided to normal html pages
(SPA: Single Page Application; The browser loads one html page and this html page is the "container" for ever page )

# Not using a framework (vanilla html)

I like it this way but many people refuse to touch vanilla stuff in frontend development


# ChangesMade.md

I temporarly commented stuff in https://github.com/RadSton/PSA-RE/blob/web-dev/buses/AEE2004.full/LS.CONF/1A3.yml#L222
My car doesnt do voice stuff so I cant go figure it out on my own
So if anybody knows how to fix write me or make a issue, pull request just make something dont let it sit closed off in your mind. pls
