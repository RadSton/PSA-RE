# Some IDs are missing in this list because there's no vehicle that seems to use it, these are:
# * COV_P and COV_C, it seems it was a project that PSA made with Faurecia that would measure the body volume of driver and passenger and send the information over CAN, it should have been used by the airbags to change the deploy volume/power so it's better suited to the people in the car, never made into a finished car apparently. They should have IDs 0x05 and 0x06 respectively. Also called BioVolume
# * Telephone Kit Main libre, i have no idea what this is for, maybe a KML but with an integrated phone instead of bluetooth? should have ID 0x14. It really looks like an older phone that was had an ID assigned and is referenced in some schematics (as number 8475), but has never made into an actual AEE2004 car, replaced by the NOMADE/KML
# * AAD/Aide Au Depassement, apparently a precursor to either SAM or Park assist, never went into an actual device, it should have id 0x21
# * EDP_ARG and EDP_ARD, which were designed to be door electronics for read (left and right), but they apparently never went into production as well
# * ESV: Front wiper, apparently there was a version that was planned to talk on CAN, but didn't made it (fortunately, why would you want a wiper on CAN?)
